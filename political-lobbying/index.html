    <h2> AIPAC, lobbying, and ethical considerations</h2>
    <p >Lobbying is a regulated yet powerful tool used by individuals, corporations, and interest groups to influence public policy and decision-making. AIPAC (the American Israel Public Affairs Committee) is one of the most influential lobbying groups in the United States, advocating on issues related to U.S.-Israel relations. 
      While lobbying is protected under the constitution, specifically the First Amendment. Ethical concerns often arise regarding disclosure, influence, and public accountability. Questions about how lobbying aligns with democratic values and whether it fairly represents constituents are central to this discussion.</p>

    <h2>What is Lobbying?</h2>
    <p>According to Duke University’s Office of Government Relations, lobbying includes activities intended to influence legislation or administrative actions, whether through direct communication with lawmakers or larger public campaigns designed to sway opinion. 
      The National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL) states that the legal definitions of lobbying and lobbyists vary from state to state.</p>
    <p>In the state of Arkansas, "lobbying" is defined as "communicating directly or soliciting others to communicate with any public servant with the purpose of influencing legislative action or administrative action." 
      A person is considered a "lobbyist" in Arkansas if they receive income or reimbursement of $400 or more in a calendar quarter for lobbying, expend $400 or more for lobbying purposes (excluding personal expenses such as travel, meals,etc.), 
      or spend $400 or more to solicit others to influence officials.</p>
