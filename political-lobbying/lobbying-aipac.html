    <h2>Top Lobbying Groups</h2>
    <p>Lobbying groups impact legislation and government priorities by representing various interests and groups. Some of the most powerful lobbying organizations in the U.S. spend tens of millions of dollars every year to shape policy. 
      Some of the top lobbying groups are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>National Association of Realtors</li>
      <li>U.S. Chamber of Commerce</li>
      <li>American Medical Association</li>
      <li>American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC)</li>
    </ul>
<p>AIPAC is a prominent pro-Israel lobbying group in the U.S. and they advocate for U.S. aid and assistance to Israel.
 This includes economic and military aid, diplomatic support, and policies aligning with Israeli government priorities.</p>

    <h2>Background and Formation of AIPAC</h2>
    <p>According to the official website of AIPAC the American Israel Public Affairs Committee was formed in 1951 and rebranded in 1959 as AIPAC. It was founded by Isaiah L. Kenen to strengthen the relationship between the U.S. and Israel through advocacy and legislative influence. 
      AIPAC describes its mission as working “to strengthen, protect and promote the U.S.-Israel relationship in ways that enhance the security of the United States and Israel.”</p>
    <P>The way that this organization operates is by building relationships with members of Congress, educating lawmakers on issues that deal with the U.S.-Israel relations, and organize its base to support legislation and candidates aligned with its goals.</P>

    <h2>AIPAC’s Objectives and Methods from an Ethical Perspective</h2>
    <p>AIPAC’s core objective is to secure and guarantee strong U.S. support for Israel, 
    specifically through military aid and the opposition to Palestinian statehood efforts at international bodies, as well as the suppression of U.S. policy criticism toward Israeli actions in Gaza and the West Bank.</p>

          <h2>Activist Group Jewish Voices for Peace</h2>
        </header>
      <p>JVP opposes Israeli occupation and apartheid policies, while also challenging U.S. political support that enables these actions. They support Palestinian-led movements such as BDS (Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions) and advocate for ending U.S. military aid to Israel. 
          JVP mobilizes Jewish communities and allies to speak out against injustice, emphasizing solidarity and anti-racism.
          Recent protests by JVP and other Jewish and human rights organizations have directly criticized AIPAC’s opposition to a ceasefire in Gaza, 
           calling attention to its role in justifying or enabling collective punishment and civilian casualties through political pressure and lobbying.
