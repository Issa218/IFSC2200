    <h2>Key Legislation and Policies </h2>
    <p>AIPAC has supported a broad range of legislation that reinforces the U.S.-Israel military and economic ties. 
    This includes pushing for increased U.S. military aid to Israel, opposing conditioning aid based on human rights standards, and backing bills that penalize support for the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement.
    AIPAC has also been influential in pushing for sanctions against countries it perceives as hostile to Israel like Iran. They often lobby for aggressive U.S. stances that usually mirror Israeli policy objectives.</p>
    <p>These lobbying efforts have created a legislative environment where critiques of Israel's policies, particularly those relating to the treatment of Palestinians, are marginalized or penalized. 
    Through bipartisan influence, AIPAC has changed and influenced how the U.S. Congress approaches Middle East policy. They often sideline debates about human rights and international law. 
    As stated in Jewish Voices for Labour, these efforts create a narrow spectrum of acceptable policy discussion, and even controlling alternative approaches to negotiation and justice in the region.</p>

        <h2> <a href="#" rel="bookmark" title="link to this post">Transparency</a> </h2>
      </header>
      <p>AIPAC's activities have raised serious ethical questions about lobbying conduct and democratic accountability. A 2019 ethics complaint filed with the Office of Congressional Ethics alleged that AIPAC had coordinated campaign donations in violation to the House rules,
     which prohibit coordinations like this with independent organizations. </p>
     <p>While AIPAC denies these claims, the incident revealed the dark and unclear ethical territory in which influential lobby groups operate.
     These ethical concerns extend beyond campaign finance. As stated in the Lobbying Institute ethics code, lobbying practices should uphold transparency, fairness, and compliance with legal boundaries. </p>

        <h2> <a href="#" rel="bookmark" title="link to this post">Foreign Policy Bias</a> </h2>
      </header>
      <p>
AIPAC’s lobbying has mostly aligned U.S. foreign policy with Israeli government interests, particularly right-wing administrations. 
This includes backing a one-sided recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, opposing nuclear diplomacy with Iran, and resisting efforts to pressure Israel on settlements or human rights issues. 
This created a clear bias in U.S. diplomatic priorities.</p>
<p>This bias is especially evident in how the United States responds to Israeli military actions on Gaza and settlement expansions in the West Bank. 
As mentioned in Jewish Voices for Labour, the bias contributes to an imbalance in how Palestinians and Israelis are treated in international discussion and policy.
 The result is a U.S. foreign policy framework that often puts Palestinian rights to the sidelines and undermines broader peace efforts.</p>

        <h2> <a href="#" rel="bookmark" title="link to this post">Disproportionate Influence</a> </h2>
      </header>
      <p>AIPAC’s influence is viewed by critics as outsized and unaccountable. Its lobbying machine has led to a culture in Washington where criticizing Israeli policy is discouraged and even politically risky. 
      This disproportionate influence over lawmakers and policy decisions raises deeper concern about democratic integrity and the role of foreign interest lobbying in U.S. domestic and international agendas.</p>
      <p>The Nation states, when a single lobby group can determine who gets funding, who gets elected, and which policy debates are considered “acceptable,” it challenges the foundational concept of representative democracy.</p>

          <h2>Track AIPAC</h2>
         <p>Track AIPAC is an initiative that is dedicated to revealing and challenging the influence of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) and the broader Israel lobby in U.S. democracy. By documenting financial contributions from pro-Israel entities to federal officials, 
          Track AIPAC’s goal is to bring transparency and hold politicians accountable for their affiliations. Additionally, Track AIPAC calls for AIPAC and similar foreign lobbying groups to register under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) and support efforts to overturn the Citizens United decision, 
          seeking to diminish the impact of money in politics. Their work is supported by Citizens Against AIPAC Corruption and utilizes data from sources like OpenSecrets.org and the Federal Election Commission to inform and educate the public in order to promote democratic integrity. <a href="https://www.trackaipac.com/">Track AIPAC &raquo;</a></p>
